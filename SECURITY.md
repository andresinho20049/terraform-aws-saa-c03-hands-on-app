## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix. We will work with you to ensure a solution is developed and deployed as quickly as possible. We will then notify you when the fix is released and provide appropriate credit for your discovery if you wish.

We appreciate your effort in helping to make this project safer for everyone.
